## Flandre-s-Adventure
<p>Probably an individual game in progress. </p>
<p>Extends from Touhou Project.</p>
<p>In this game, you will be able to control Flandre Scarlet, a vampire been prisoned for almost 500 years.</p>
<p>That day, she broke the basement that always confines her. </p>
<p>She went out, embracing the noble world.</p>
<p>Everything she met on her exploration, its fate is decided by you. </p>
<p>Be friendly or simply destroy them? </p>
<p>Different choices will largely impact the game's process and ending. </p>

## Game Play
<p>For now, it might be a rpg game, with several customized Mechanics, which makes it unique.</p>
<p>The user might be able to interact with all kinds of objects in the game. </p>
<p>More and more cute Tachie on the way...</p>
