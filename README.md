## Flandre-s-Adventure

Probably an individual game in progress. 

Extends from Touhou Project.

In this game, you will be able to control Flandre Scarlet, a vampire been prisoned for almost 500 years.

That day, she broke the basement that always confines her.

She went out, embracing the noble world.

Everything she met on her exploration, its fate is decided by you.

Be friendly or simply destroy them? 

Different choices will largely impact the game's process and ending. 

## Game Play

For now, it might be a rpg game, with several customized Mechanics, which makes it unique.

The user might be able to interact with all kinds of objects in the game. 

More and more cute Tachie on the way...
